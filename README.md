Now is testting！
A beta version has been released!
There may be a lot of bugs, but it still works.
Put KK_osr2_sr6_link.dll into the game mod directory and the software opens after the game is run.
I'll post a tutorial on how to use it some time later.
The suggested catalog for the game is similar to the following: E:\galgame\kk\Koikatu
Failure to do so may result in some unintended errors.
But there are ways around it.
I'll fix it in my next update.
Do not change the interval time setting！！！
